## Swiper 3.0.0 - Released on February 11, 2015

      * Android 4+, multirow mode only for Android 4.4+
      * Latest Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Opera desktop browsers
      * WP 8+, IE 10+, 3D effects may not work correctly on IE 10 because of wrong nested 3D transform support
    * Scroll Container. Removed in favor of pure CSS `overflow: auto` with `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`
  * New features
    * Swiper now uses modern flexbox layout, which by itself give more features and advantages
    * Such Swiper 2.x plugins as Hash Navigation, Smooth Progress, 3D Flow and Scrollbar are now incoroporated into Swiper 3.x core
    * Full RTL support
    * Built-in navigation buttons/arrows
    * Controller. Now one Swiper could be controlled (or control itself) by another Swiper
    * Multi row slides layout with `slidesPerColumn` option
    * Better support for nested Swipers, now it is possible to use same-direction nested Swipers, like horizontal in horizontal
    * Space between slides
    * New transition effects: 3D Coverflow, 3D Cube and Fade transitions
    * Slides are `border-box` now, so it is possible to use borders and paddings directly on slides
    * Auto layout mode (`slidesPerView: 'auto'`) now gives more freedom, you can even specify slides sizes in % and use margins on them
    * Mutation Observers. If enabled, Swiper will watch for changes in Dom and update its layout automatically
    * Better clicks prevention during swiping
  * Many of API methods, parameters and callbacks are changed
  * Added a bit lightweight jQuery/Zepto version of Swiper that can be used if you use jQuery/Zepto in your project
