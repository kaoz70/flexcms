## Introduction

Cartalyst's RESTful API package is designed to help you build modular, "API-first" RESTful applications. It makes it easy for you to build API's with support for authentication, rate limiting *(coming soon)* and versioning. 

The application's different components are separated and talk to each other through the same RESTful API externally. Internally, object instances are returned (instead of JSON or arrays) and rate limits are bypassed.
