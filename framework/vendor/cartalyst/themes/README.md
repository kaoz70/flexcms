# Themes

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/cartalyst/themes.svg?token=98Zt8zYdwyheTKqziswS&branch=3.0)](https://travis-ci.com/cartalyst/themes)

Themes enhances any application by providing a common feature set that most developers and frontend designers patchwork together. A common problem associated with the presentation layer of application design is often directly associated with the workflow of your team. Providing a standard that can be looked to day in and day out is essential to lowering team confusion and overhead.

The package requires PHP 5.3+ and follows the FIG standard PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code and is fully unit-tested.
