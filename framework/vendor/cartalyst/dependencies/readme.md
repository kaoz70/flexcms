#Dependencies
Our dependencies package is a simple package which allows you to sort dependencies, be it assets, simple strings, or class instances. It's clever enough to avoid circular dependencies in a never-ending loop. 

Part of the Cartalyst Arsenal & licensed [OSI BSD 3](license.txt). Code well, rock on.
