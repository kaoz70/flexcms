[![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/cartalyst/sentinel-social.svg?token=98Zt8zYdwyheTKqziswS&branch=2.0)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/cartalyst/sentinel-social)

Sentinel Social is a `Sentinel` addon that makes authenticating your users through social networks & third-party OAuth providers in Sentinel an absolute breeze.

The package requires PHP 5.4+ and comes bundled with a Laravel 4 Facade and a Service Provider to simplify the optional framework integration and follows the FIG standard PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code and is fully unit-tested.

Part of the Cartalyst Arsenal & licensed [Cartalyst PSL](LICENSE). Code well, rock on.
